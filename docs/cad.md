# CAD Models

All CAD models and drawings were made using SolidWorks 16-17. 


## CAD Archives

These are archives that I have made for various people over time. They may not
be up to date. If you can use SolidWorks files then you should download from 
the [SolidWorks Modles][2] directory.

CAD archives are available in these formats:

  * SolidWorks 16-17
  * Fusion 360
  * STEP
  * IGS

These files are located in the [`CAD Models/CAD Archives`][1] directory.

I may be able to provide other CAD formats upon request. [Open an Issue][i]
and I will see what I can do for you.


## SolidWorks Models

This is my working directory and has the most up to date models. There are two
subdirectories, one contains the models of the main castings pre-conversion, and
before any modifications. The other contains the models of the converted machine.

These files are located in the [`CAD Models/SolidWorks Models`][2] directory and
are all in SolidWorks 16-17 format.
