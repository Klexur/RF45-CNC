# SolidWorks Models

These are SolidWorks 16-17 format solid models of the complete CNC conversion. 
I may be able to provide other CAD formats upon request, just [open an Issue][1]
and I will see what I can do for you.


**Note** You should Download this entire folder so the part relations stay intact.
