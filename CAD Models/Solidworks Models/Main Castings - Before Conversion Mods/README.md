The CAD files in this folder are very accurate models of the original castings
before any modifications for CNC conversion. Very accurate means that critical
dimensions such as ways and hole locations are within about .005 of what they
measured on my machine, noncritical dimensions such as casting wall thicknesses
should be within about .05. You machine will likely very significantly from mine,
use with discretion.

File format is Solidworks 2016-17.  I might be able to provide other file formats 
on request.
