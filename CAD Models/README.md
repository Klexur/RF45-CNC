# CAD Models

All CAD models and drawings were made using SolidWorks 16-17.  

Currently CAD achives are available in these formats:

  * SolidWorks 16-17
  * Fusion 360
  * IGS
  * STEP

I may be able to provide other CAD formats upon request. [Open an Issue][1]
and I will see what I can do for you.


**Note** You should Download this entire folder so the part relations stay intact.
